# East House Enrichment Program @ RIT, June 2023
This workshop will provide an introduction to core software programming concepts. Each student will work individually and in small groups to write programs that generate pictures of their own design. On day two, we’ll work together to add interactivity to the images by changing what the program does depending on the user’s mouse and/or keyboard actions. 

## Overview
In this class, we'll be writing *JavaScript* programs that utilize the *p5.js library* to support drawing shapes onto a digital canvas.

Since our time is limited, the primary goal is to give everyone a chance to see what is possible wih p5, run some pre-made programs, and learn a few programming concepts so that you can customize the programs.
