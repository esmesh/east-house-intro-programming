# Setting up your "development environment"
In order to write and run a computer program, we need a "development environment": *the set of tools needed to plan, write, and run our programs.*

In this workshop, your development environment will be:
- This website!
- An online editor that runs p5.js programs
- Your notebook!

## Accessing the workshop resources
1. Log into a lab computer using the account info on the whiteboard.
2. Open the Chrome web browser using the `East House 2023` shortcut on the desktop
    - This opens the workshop website: <a href="https://esmesh.github.io/east-house-intro-programming/" target="_blank">https://esmesh.github.io/east-house-intro-programming/</a>

## Using the online p5.js editor
> *p5.js is a JavaScript library for creative coding, with a focus on making coding accessible and inclusive for artists, designers, educators, beginners, and anyone else!* (<a href="https://p5js.org/" target="_blank">p5js.org</a>)

We're using it because it lets you get up and running quickly so you can play with some core computing concepts and see immediate results. :)

### Open (& login if you want) the editor
Without logging in, you can write and run programs using an online p5.js editor: <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/" target="_blank">https://editor.p5js.org/</a>

If you want to be able to **save** your work for later:
1. In the top right corner, select `Sign Up`
2. If you have a Google email address, you can sign up via `Login with Google`
3. If you want to create a new login:
    1. Decide on a username and password.
    2. Enter an email address *(if you don't have a personal email address, we can help you create one)*
    3. Click `Sign Up`

### Create a new sketch
Use `File -> New` to create a new default program.

*The editor will give it some kind of silly default name (e.g., "Fossil accelerator"). You can change the name to whatever you want.*

### Running the program
Press the play button to run the program. The default sketch will draw a single gray square.

## Why do we still need notebooks?!
It helps to always have a plan of what we want to do before we ever touch a computer! 

Professional software engineers use paper, whiteboards, etc. to brainstorm & collect ideas. This saves us time & rework later!

Because we'll be writing programs that generate 2d images, you'll make plans by drawing mockups of the final image on a grid.

For example, for a 200x200 pixel image, our starting plan in our notebook would be a grid (with as few/many sub-lines as you want) that notes that the top left corner has X & Y coordinates of (0, 0). The bottom right is (200,200);

If we wanted to draw a heart, the first step would be to think about the basic shapes needed. That's a mental/planning activity. No code needed!
