## Letting the computer do the math
The [smiley face](Smiley.md) example is nice, but it's pretty frustrating to have to work out the exact coordinates/sizes for every shape. Especially if we want to make more complex images.

It'd be a LOT easier to tell the program to make a *"rectangle on the bottom third of the canvas"* or a *"circle in the middle"*.

The computer doesn't understand plain English, but it can at least let us define some base labels & sizes and then do the math for us.
