## Setting up
In order to write and run a computer program, we need a "development environment": the set of tools needed to plan, write, and run our programs. In this class, your development environment will be:

- PAPER!
    - *Even software programmers use paper! It helps to always have a plan of what we want to do before we ever touch a computer!*
    - We're going to use graph paper because it makes planning where/how to draw shapes easier.
    - We'll also give you printed copies of these references so you don't have to take a lot of notes.
- A web browser on the computer
- An online editor that runs p5.js programs
- A list of resources to see for more help when needed

### Logging into the computer and opening Chrome ![chrome_logo.png](images/chrome_logo.png)
At the start of each class:
1. Log into a lab computer using the account info on the whiteboard.
2. Open the Chrome web browser
3. Open the webpage for this class: <a href="https://esmesh.github.io/east-house-intro-programming/" target="_blank">https://esmesh.github.io/east-house-intro-programming/</a>
    - That will open the main schedule for the course. From there, you can click on any topic to see the details.

### Online editor
Without logging in, you can write and run programs using an online p5.js editor: <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/" target="_blank">https://editor.p5js.org/</a>

ALL of the example code we'll use is here: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/east-house-p5-2023" target="_blank">https://tinyurl.com/east-house-p5-2023</a>
