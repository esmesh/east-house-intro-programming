## Setting up
In order to write and run a computer program, we need a "development environment": the set of tools needed to plan, write, and run our programs. In this class, your development environment will be:

- Your notebook!
    - *Even software programmers use paper! It helps to always have a plan of what we want to do before we ever touch a computer!*
- A web browser on the computer
- An online editor that runs p5.js programs
- A list of resources to see for more help when needed

### Your notebook
Your notebook is a place for you to collect thoughts and information from the class:
1. Inside cover/first page:
    - *Your name, account login information, etc.*
2. Graph paper
    - For sketching out what you want your programs to do
3. Pocket
    - Collecting handouts, etc.
    
### Logging into the computer and opening Chrome ![chrome_logo.png](chrome_logo.png)
At the start of each class:
1. Log into a lab computer using the RIT account given to you.
2. Open the Chrome web browser
3. Type the following address into Chrome to open the webpage for this class:
```
https://esmesh.github.io/east-house-intro-programming/
```
4. That will open the main schedule for the course. From there, you can click on any topic to see the details.

### Online editor
In this class, we'll be writing *JavaScript* programs that utilize the *p5.js library* to support drawing shapes onto a digital canvas.

In order to write and **save** programs, we'll be using an online p5.js editor. The first step is to open the editor and create a new account.
1. Go to <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/" target="_blank">https://editor.p5js.org/</a>
2. In the top right corner, select `Sign Up`
3. Decide on a username and password **(write these down in your notebook!)**.
4. Enter an email address (if you don't have a personal email address, we can help you create one)
5. Click `Sign Up`
