# Things to try!

### In the [Hello World](Hello.md):
- Change the text to have your name
- Use a different background color *(See <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp" target="_blank">https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp</a> for the possible color names.)*
- Add new text somewhere else on the canvas

### In the [Smiley](smileDemoCode.md) demo:
- Change some colors
- Make the face, eyes, and/or nose bigger
- Add some freckles
- Change the ORDER of some statements *(What happens if the call to draw the face is last?!)*
- Change the sizes/placement of the sample shapes at the bottom

### In the [Flower](flowerDemoCode.md) demo:
- Change ***only*** the `canvasSize` variables.
- Change the flower height or width
- Try adding a bee 1 `flowerWidth` to the right of the top of the flower stem
    - *This is abstract art, the "bee" can be a simple circle or oval. ;)*
    - The top of the flower stem has variables for its X & Y coordinates: `stemTopX` and `stemTopY`

### Implement the heart example
- Start with the diagram from the [Getting Started](GettingStarted.md) page
- Draw out the layout in your notebook
- What shapes do you need?
- What are their coordinates/sizes?
- *[See a solution here](HeartExample.md)*

# Design your own project!
*Feel free to ask us for help at any point along the way!*

### Planning
1. Sketch out your vision on graph paper
2. Identify the major sub-shapes & colors
3. Label with coordinates (or with the math you want the computer to do to figure out the coordinates)

### Implementation
1. Create a new p5.js sketch project
2. Set the canvas size in `setup()`
3. Set the background color in `draw()`
4. Start writing the code to draw the shapes you need.
